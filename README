== INTRODUCTION

This project was created for the Encyclopedia of Life by Natural Guides LLC. It contains code for an application
built specifically for the Apple iPhone. The application allows users to take photographs, submit the photos to
a group in the Flickr photo sharing website. It also helps the user tag the photo with the name of the organism
featured in the photograph. The Encyclopedia of Life regularly indexes its group in Flickr and will feature
any properly submitted images on its EOL taxon pages.

You can find this application in the Apple iTunes Store by going to:

Apple iTunes application)
